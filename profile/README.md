The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging cultures, interests, technical and organisational aspects as it concerns the metaverse. In other words, we "interoperate" people and projects that have some opinion about what the metaverse is. Our members include businesses and individuals, technical and creative people, academics, innovators and implementers, working towards this common goal.

## The OMI vision

We bolster our community members, supporting them in building projects that seek to define and build the metaverse (or related things) as an open and interoperable entity.

## OMI Core Values

- We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## Working groups:

- glTF extensions
The glTF extensions group, focused on interoperable 3D assets, is currently our most active group.
The easiest way to try OMI protocols, is to check out our [glTF extensions](https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions#omi-gltf-vendor-extensions). We are always seeking implementers and [collaborators](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup#active-subgroups). Communication happens on Discord, in the [#omi-glTF-extensions channel](https://discord.com/channels/887789163045335081/887789163045335087). We meet weekly on Thursdays at 16:00 UTC in summer, and 17:00 UTC in winter.
- curator
The curator group manages being a trumpet for our members, sharing and collating relevant information.

### Future groups planned:
- physical world interoperability
Aspects of the physical world interoperability group includes immersive games, incorporating physical world assets into games, digital twins and geospatial related work. Currently this group exists as a [Discord forum post](https://discord.com/channels/887789163045335081/1344003597528076340), pending members and funding outcome.
- convergence cultures
The convergence cultures group is concerned with online communities that bridge games or platforms. Using the term coined by [Henry Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_culture), convergence culture relates to participatory culture, collective intelligence and a converging technological environment. Currently this group exists as a [Discord forum post](https://discord.com/channels/887789163045335081/1344002958911733760), pending members and funding outcome.

### Groups in ideation phase
- Hypermedia

Our groups bridge technical, social and organisational aspects. We collaborate with other metaverse organisations, with our niche being on grassroots efforts and a commitment to open ecosystems. 

Whatever the metaverse means to you, you are welcome here. 

Interested? We would love if you [get involved with our community](https://discord.gg/Wqt4ZC4zjF) or [otherwise contribute](https://opencollective.com/omigroup). We hope to see you within our [working groups](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup#active-subgroups (to be updated)). Bring a friend!
