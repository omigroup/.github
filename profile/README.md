The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.

The easiest way to try OMI protocols, is to check out our [glTF extensions](https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions#omi-gltf-vendor-extensions). You can see protocols like ours in-action, on [our website](https://omigroup.org) (scroll to the bottom and click `enter world`!) We are always seeking implementers and [collaborators](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup#active-subgroups). 

Interested? We would love if you [get involved with our community](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) or [otherwise contributed](https://opencollective.com/omigroup). We hope to see you within our [working groups](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup#active-subgroups). Bring a friend!

## OMI Core Values

- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
